# DataLemur-Interview-Questions
Ever since I stumbled upon Nick Singh's DataLemur platform, I’ve found it to be a fantastic resource for learning and keeping one's SQL skills sharp. The platform offers well-structured interview questions from real-world companies that challenge both foundational and advanced SQL concepts.

Since my current work projects don’t require me to use SQL extensively, I see this as a great opportunity to stay sharp by solving and exploring these challenges. Also, since I've been enjoying the SQL challenges so much I have decided to solve the Python ones too.

This repository will be constantlyy updated with the solutions to SQL and Python challenges as I am approaching them.

Would love to hear any feedback or alternative approaches!
